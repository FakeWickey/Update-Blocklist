# Development Roadmap
* whitelisting Domains
* manually blacklisting domains
* dashboard displaying stats
* update-blocklist working with <database> or <configuration files>
* refactoring the code (making it smaller & more efficient)
* writing a tool that shows which adlists have the best domains (add most unique domains)
* parallel downloading & parsing
* more direct way of interacting with update-blocklist script (e.g. for disabling functionality)
